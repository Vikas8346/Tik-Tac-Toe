# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

This repository contains the code for a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is a classic two-player game, where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Features 🕹️

- **Two-player mode**: Play against a friend locally.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly and visually appealing game board.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects win conditions and displays the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: Recognizes when the game results in a tie.

## How to Play ⚔️

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 starts with **X**, and Player 2 takes **O**.
3. Players take turns marking an empty square on the grid.
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has won, the game ends in a **draw**.
